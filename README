Goal - predict my door to door commute time for any given day

dataset: my location history

features: 
- day of month
- day of week
- month of year
- year
- time left house
- commute direction
- commute time

feature generation:
  for each day of data, grab all points close to home and close to work. order chronologically. coalesce to find candidate commutes. drop any commute that takes less than 30 minutes or more than 3.5 hours. 


== Installation steps ==

 1. Download your location data from Google Takeout
